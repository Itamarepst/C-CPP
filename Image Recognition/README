  <p align="center">
    <b>Image Recognition, Neural Network</b> is the 4th exercise I've solved in Huji's <b>Programming Workshop in C & C++</b> course.
    <br>
    The main idea behind this exercise is to get familiar with <b>Neural Networks</b> and <b>Image Recognition</b> as well as the basics of <b>C++</b>.
